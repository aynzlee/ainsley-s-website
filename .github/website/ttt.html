        <p>A generic tic-tac-toe game suitable for 3 players. Played on a 4x4 grid.</p>
    
        Inspired by the famous tic tac toe game usually played with 2 players,
        this version of tic tac toe is played with 3 players.
        <br><br>
        Each player has either a sun, moon or star icon. The game is played on a larger grid (4x4)
        to account of the extra player and the win condition is also increased to 4 in a row.
        <br><br>
        Tic tac toe is a rather algorithmic game, as such, this program
        was created with different functions that are able to loop depending on player input.
        <br><br>
        This program is the first ever program I coded! This game was developed with a group of 5 using Python.
