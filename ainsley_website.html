        <p>This website is a digital archive for all the projects I complete during the summer.
        <br><br>
        I began this project from scratch with no knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
        It felt intimidating at first and I had so many complex ideas that I wanted to implement straight away.
        However, as with many things, before you can get to the fun, cool and exciting parts 
        itâ€™s probably a good idea to know the basics thoroughly.
        <br><br>
        This website is coded with very basic HTML and CSS.
        I first began learning HTML with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a>'s free full stack
        developer course. 
        While learning, I decided to begin the process of building my website simultaneously.
        Oftentimes, the concepts that I had googled for a specific problem or display would then be 
        taught to me in the course which allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of HTML/CSS. 
        <br><br>
        Since then, I have been iterating this website every time 
        I get a new idea or if I think a page could benefit with more details or maybe
        if it could be better structured.
